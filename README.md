### Abstract
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, which has emerged as the backbone of many systems across multiple industries. Blockchains are generally described as immutable and append-only data structures, but this characterization neglects the rich semantics of the ledgers. As a result, researchers have developed a variety of semantics models to explain and categorize different behaviors of various blockchain implementations.

The semantics of these systems are complex because of their many corner cases and subtle distinctions. For example, researchers must distinguish a single node from a network of nodes, a blockchain from an overlay network, and a permissioned ledger from a permissionless ledger, and many more. While the semantics of blockchains have been studied extensively in academic research, there is little consensus on how these systems should be categorized. This paper presents an overview of major semantics models for decentralized ledger systems and summarizes the motivations behind each category. It also identifies the advantages and disadvantages of the different semantics models and provides recommendations for future research.

This paper attempts to answer the following question: What is the blockchain future?
